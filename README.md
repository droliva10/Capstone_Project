#**Project 2**
# **Webserver Vulnerabilities**

In this project, I am working on a Red vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

I attacked a vulnerable VM within an Azure environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. Than using Kibana, I reviewed the logs and I extracted the hard data for a visualization report.

Lastly, I interpreted the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit I successfully performed.
