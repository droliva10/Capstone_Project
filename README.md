#**Project 2**
# **Capstone Engagement**

In this project, I am working on a Red vs. Blue Team scenario in which I will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, I will attack a vulnerable VM with in a Azure environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I will use Kibana to review logs following the engagement. I will use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for the report.

Then, I will interpret the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each explouit that I successfully performed.
